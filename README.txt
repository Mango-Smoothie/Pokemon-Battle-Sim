Please make sure all files from the zip are in the same folder when running PokemonFP.py.
There are two csv files that can be run, PokemonRoster0 and PokemonRoster1. PokemonRoster0 contains 
the creators' preferences, and PokemonRoster1 is used for demo to an audience. To choose 
which roster to run, please change the filename in "stats = PokeStats('PokemonRoster#.csv')" at the
beginning of the main() function in Python to the desired file.

Thank you!
